# Projects from Dataquest

This repository is for sharing some of my projects from Dataquest.  Each of the projects I completed is listed below along with some notes on the concepts and methods used.

## Project_01: [Numbers of Births](https://github.com/Frizzles7/Dataquest/blob/master/Project_01/Basics.ipynb)
This introductory project practices reading in a file, splitting data, creating a dictionary, and summarizing counts.

## Project_02: [Births](https://github.com/Frizzles7/Dataquest/blob/master/Project_02/Basics.ipynb)
This project continues with the births dataset and uses dictionaries, loops, creating functions, and calculating some summary statistics.

## Project_03 [Gun Deaths](https://github.com/Frizzles7/Dataquest/blob/master/Project_03/Basics.ipynb)
This project explores data on gun deaths and uses datetime, dictionaries, and loops to draw conclusions.

## Project_04 [eBay Car Sales](https://github.com/Frizzles7/Dataquest/blob/master/Project_04/Basics.ipynb)
This project investigates car sales on Germany's eBay website and uses NumPy and Pandas to summarize and clean the data.  Examples of methods used include info, head, describe, value_counts, and unique.

## Project_05 [Earnings by College Major](https://github.com/Frizzles7/Dataquest/blob/master/Project_05/Basics.ipynb)
This project looks at earnings by college major and explores different visualizations using Pandas and Matplotlib.  Examples of visualizations used include scatter plots, histograms, scatter matrix plots, bar graphs, grouped histograms, box plots, and hexagonal bin plots.

## Project_06 [Gender Gap in College Degrees](https://github.com/Frizzles7/Dataquest/blob/master/Project_06/Basics.ipynb)
This project looks at the degrees awarded by gender and uses different visualizations with more customizations.  Examples include using options to change the size, layout, labels, tick marks, colors, and other display parameters in the visualizations. 

## Project_07 [NYC High Schools](https://github.com/Frizzles7/Dataquest/blob/master/Project_07/Schools.ipynb)
This project incorporates data on New York City high schools.  Data is initially provided in multiple files, which I combine and convert data to numeric data, using regex as needed.  Data visualizations used include scatter plots, bar graphs, and a map using basemap.
