# Project 10

In this project, we looked at 1000 rows of a dataset for submissions to Hacker News from 2006 to 2015.

We wrote scripts to answer some main questions:
- What words appear most often in the headlines?
- What domains were submitted most often to Hacker News?
- At what times are the most articles submitted?
